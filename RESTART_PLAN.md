# Quest-CMS Restart Plan

## üéØ Issues to Address on Restart

### 1. Railway GitHub Integration
**Problem**: Cannot find how to link GitHub repo to Railway for auto-deployment
**Solution**: Research Railway GitHub integration process and implement properly

### 2. Project Structure Cleanup
**Current Issues**:
- README.md exists but CLAUDE.md should be the primary file
- Missing credentials.md for project-specific credentials
- Missing proper Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Need to follow Archon methodology for complete structure

**Required Actions**:
- Merge README.md content into CLAUDE.md, delete README.md
- Create credentials.md with project-specific credentials
- Create PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md following Archon methodology
- Implement complete Archon project structure

### 3. Archon Methodology Implementation
**Why**: Since we need PRD anyway, implement full Archon methodology properly
**Benefits**: 
- Complete, standardized project structure
- Proper documentation hierarchy
- GitHub integration specifications
- Railway deployment automation

## üìã Restart Action Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Structure
1. **Railway GitHub Integration Research**
   - Find correct Railway GitHub connection process
   - Document step-by-step integration
   - Implement auto-deployment from GitHub

2. **Archon Methodology Implementation**
   - Research current Archon methodology from knowledge base
   - Create complete Archon project structure
   - Generate proper PRD following Archon patterns

### Phase 2: Project Restructure
1. **File Consolidation**
   - Merge README.md ‚Üí CLAUDE.md 
   - Delete README.md
   - Create credentials.md with project credentials
   - Create PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md

2. **Archon Structure Implementation**
   - Implement full Archon directory structure
   - Create all required Archon documentation files
   - Follow Archon naming conventions

### Phase 3: Deployment Integration
1. **Railway Setup**
   - Connect GitHub repo to Railway properly
   - Configure auto-deployment
   - Test production deployment
   - Verify admin interface works live

## üöÄ Expected Outcome
- Complete Archon methodology implementation
- Proper Railway GitHub auto-deployment
- Clean, standardized project structure
- Working production Quest-CMS

## üìù Context for Restart
- **Current Status**: Local Quest-CMS working perfectly (http://localhost:8080/admin)
- **GitHub**: Code pushed successfully to https://github.com/Londondannyboy/quest-cms
- **Railway**: URL exists but not connected to GitHub repo
- **Credentials**: Available in /Users/dankeegan/credentials/quest-credentials.md
- **Token**: Railway token 22ada421-9487-45a3-b8cf-1ba21b9b39de

---

**Next Action**: Research Archon methodology and Railway GitHub integration, then implement complete restructure.
