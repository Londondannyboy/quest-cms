# Quest-CMS Spec Kit Integration Guide

## 🎉 **Current Status: READY TO USE**

Quest-CMS is now fully integrated with **GitHub Spec Kit** for specification-driven development. All slash commands are available and ready for immediate use.

## 📁 **What's Already Configured**

### ✅ Spec Kit Files in Place
```
.specify/
├── memory/           # Project memory (constitution, principles)
├── scripts/          # Slash command implementations
├── specs/            # Feature specifications (empty, ready for use)
└── templates/        # Specification templates
```

### ✅ Claude Integration
- Slash commands available in Claude Code
- Templates configured for Quest ecosystem
- Scripts executable and tested

## 🚀 **How to Use Spec Kit with Quest-CMS**

### **Step 1: Start Here (Your Next Session)**

Open Claude Code and run:
```bash
/constitution "Quest-CMS development principles focusing on AI-first content management, human review quality gates, NiceGUI performance optimization, and PostgreSQL scalability"
```

This establishes the foundation for all future development.

### **Step 2: Define Your Next Feature**

Choose one of these example features or define your own:
```bash
# Example: Enhanced Content Generation
/specify "Create advanced content generation workflow where users can input topics, get AI-generated article drafts with quality scoring, review and edit content with real-time preview, and publish with one-click to multiple formats"

# Example: Content Analytics
/specify "Build content performance analytics dashboard showing article engagement metrics, AI generation success rates, user review patterns, and content optimization recommendations"

# Example: Multi-modal Content
/specify "Add support for generating and managing images alongside text content, with automatic image optimization, alt text generation, and responsive image serving"
```

### **Step 3: Complete the Workflow**

After `/specify`, continue with:
```bash
/plan "Use existing NiceGUI and PostgreSQL stack, integrate additional AI services as needed"
/tasks
/implement
```

## 📋 **Example Complete Workflow**

Here's what a full specification-driven feature development looks like:

### Phase 1: Constitution (Once per project)
```bash
/constitution "Quest-CMS principles: AI-first with human oversight, sub-2-second response times, PostgreSQL-first data architecture, NiceGUI real-time interface, Railway cloud deployment"
```

### Phase 2: Feature Specification
```bash
/specify "Add content versioning system allowing users to save multiple drafts of articles, compare versions side-by-side, restore previous versions, and track content evolution with automatic timestamps and change descriptions"
```

### Phase 3: Technical Planning
```bash
/plan "Extend existing PostgreSQL schema with content_versions table, add versioning UI components to NiceGUI interface, implement diff algorithm for content comparison, use existing authentication and session management"
```

### Phase 4: Task Generation
```bash
/tasks
```

### Phase 5: Implementation
```bash
/implement
```

## 🎯 **Benefits You'll See Immediately**

### **For You**
- **Clear Direction**: Know exactly what to build before coding starts
- **Reduced Scope Creep**: Specifications prevent feature bloat
- **Better Communication**: Clear requirements for AI assistance
- **Quality Gates**: Systematic validation at each phase

### **For AI (Me)**
- **Better Understanding**: Clear context from specifications
- **Focused Implementation**: Know the "why" behind requirements
- **Consistent Quality**: Follow established patterns and principles
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Less guessing, more precision

## 📊 **What Files Get Created**

When you run the commands, here's what Spec Kit creates:

```
.specify/
├── memory/
│   └── constitution.md              # Your project principles
├── specs/
│   └── 001-feature-name/
│       ├── spec.md                  # Feature requirements
│       ├── plan.md                  # Technical implementation
│       ├── tasks.md                 # Development tasks
│       └── research.md              # Supporting research
└── [scripts and templates remain]
```

## 🔍 **How to View Current Spec Kit Status**

```bash
# Check if Spec Kit is working
ls .specify/

# View any existing constitution
cat .specify/memory/constitution.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No constitution yet - run /constitution"

# Check for existing specs
ls .specify/specs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No specifications yet - run /specify"
```

## 🎓 **Learning Path**

### **Week 1: Basic Workflow**
1. **Day 1**: Run `/constitution` to establish principles
2. **Day 2**: Try `/specify` with a simple feature
3. **Day 3**: Use `/plan` to see technical breakdown
4. **Day 4**: Generate `/tasks` and review structure
5. **Day 5**: Run `/implement` and observe the process

### **Week 2: Advanced Features**
1. Use `/clarify` for complex requirements
2. Try `/analyze` for quality validation
3. Iterate on specifications
4. Document learnings in Obsidian

## 📚 **Knowledge Base Integration**

Your Obsidian vault now contains complete Spec Kit documentation:
- **Overview**: What Spec Kit is and why it works
- **Workflow**: Step-by-step process
- **Commands**: Detailed command reference
- **Best Practices**: Proven patterns
- **Templates**: Reusable specifications

**Location**: `/Users/dankeegan/Documents/Obsidian Vault/📋 Methodologies/Spec Kit/`

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **What's Different Now**
- **Before**: Conversational development with unclear requirements
- **After**: Specification-first development with clear phases
- **Result**: Better outcomes, less rework, clearer communication

### **Railway Deployment Unchanged**
- Same deployment process to Railway
- Same GitHub integration steps
- Same environment variables
- **Only difference**: Better development process leading to deployment

### **Archon for Later**
- Archon setup preserved at `/Users/dankeegan/archon-quest-ecosystem/`
- Can be activated when you have multiple projects
- Provides knowledge sharing across Quest ecosystem
- **For now**: Focus on Spec Kit, add Archon when scaling

## 🎯 **Your Next Action**

**Start your next Claude Code session with**:
```bash
/constitution "Quest-CMS development principles..."
```

This will establish the foundation for all future Spec Kit development and demonstrate the immediate value of specification-driven development.
